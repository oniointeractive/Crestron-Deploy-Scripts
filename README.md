## How to use scripts?

Crestron Deploy Scripts are made to simplify uploading the cpz file to the Crestron processor. You can use Secured version if the processor is password protected, or Unsecured version if it is not.

Make sure you have installed <a href="https://sdkcon78221.crestron.com/sdk/Crestron_EDK_SDK/Content/Topics/Installation.htm" target="_blank">Crestron EDK</a> on your local machine.

Here are the steps that you need to follow:
<ul>
  <li>Download scripts on your local computer</li>
  <li>Open the start menu, and type Powershell</li>
  <li>Choose Run ISE as Administrator</li>
  <li>Open a script inside Powershell</li>
  <li>Edit the variables by following the comments that are written inside the scripts</li>
  <li>Run the script by pressing F5 or clicking on the Run Script button (green triangle)</li>
  <li>OPTIONAL - You can also run a script by pressing right-click on the file and choosing <b>Run with PowerShell</b></li>
</ul>
